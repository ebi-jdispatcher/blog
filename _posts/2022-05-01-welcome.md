Welcome to our new blog! We are happy to welcome our users into this new space where we are going to share service updates and other news.

This blog is maintained by the Job Dispatcher Team at [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). We are responsible for developing the Job Dispatcher and Dbfetch services, which are accessible from the EMBL-EBI website. You can learn more about what we do in our [EMBL EBI's Team Services](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/teams/jdispatcher) page.

In this blog we aim to provide general service updates and announcements, 
for example when we add new datasets or tools to our collection.
We plan to provide regular updates related to the datasets we provide with useful metrics, such as the number of sequences available from the latest release. 
Additionally, we will also post about our last publications and upcoming training events. 

Stay tuned!
