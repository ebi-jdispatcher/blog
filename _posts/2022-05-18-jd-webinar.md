On the 25th May, Nandana Madhusoodanan is going to deliver a webinar about "Exploring sequence alignment tools with Job Dispatcher". 

This webinar will introduce a list of sequence alignment resources available in Job Dispatcher. This will include both pairwise and multiple sequence alignment tools and provide some useful tips for using the tools.

In addition to accessing these tools via the web browser, this webinar will also demonstrate accessing them by using the API.

### Who is this course for?
This webinar is aimed at individuals who are interested to learn about using sequence alignment tools in their studies/research. No previous bioinformatics experience is required, however, basic knowledge of command-line will be appreciated (not mandatory) for applying the API.

### Outcomes
By the end of the webinar you will be able to:

* Describe what sequence alignment is
* Identify alignment tools available in Job Dispatcher 
* Perform sequence alignment both programmatically and using the web browser
