On the 22th of July of last year, [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) and [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/) released the most complete database of predicted 3D structures of human proteins<sup>1</sup>. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today with <a href="https://twitter.com/emblebi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emblebi</a>, we&#39;re launching the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlphaFold?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AlphaFold</a> Protein Structure Database, which offers the most complete and accurate picture of the human proteome, doubling humanityâ€™s accumulated knowledge of high-accuracy human protein structures - for free: <a href="https://t.co/vtBGmTkKhy">https://t.co/vtBGmTkKhy</a> 1/ <a href="https://t.co/XgBQTn2fuC">pic.twitter.com/XgBQTn2fuC</a></p>&mdash; DeepMind (@DeepMind) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepMind/status/1418225170523705345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The initial release provided ~350,000 structure models including 20 biologically-significant organisms such as E.coli, fruit fly, mouse, zebrafish, malaria parasite and tuberculosis bacteria. The second release of the AlphaFold DB was composed by 992,316 structure models. That is >400,000 new protein structure predictions for most of the manually-curated [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) entries in UniProtKB/SwissProt.

A year since the initial release, AlphaFold latest release<sup>2</sup> provides an astronomical increase in the number of predicted 3D structures available. From less than a million to a whopping 214,684,311 structures. Deputy Director General and Joint Director of EMBL-EBI, Ewan Birney, said:

> From today, the database has been expanded from one million protein structure predictions to more than 200 million, covering almost the whole of UniProt. 
>
> Todayâ€™s update includes structures for the widest possible range of species - including plants, bacteria, and additional animals and organisms. This expansion will help countless more scientists, including EMBL colleagues, in their work, and improve the quality and quantity of our research outputs. 

This dataset release is available for sequence searching in our [Sequence Similarity Search](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sss/) bioinformatics applications and [Dbfetch](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/dbfetch/).
